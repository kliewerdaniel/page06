<InfoBlock title="Module Overview">
  **Duration:** Week 1  
  **Status:** Active  
  **Type:** Foundation Module  

  Welcome to your transformation from developer to Gen-AI engineer. This foundational week establishes your professional development environment, clarifies the Gen-AI engineering role, and creates your personalized learning roadmap. You'll emerge with a clear understanding of where you're headed and all the tools needed to get there.

  **The Big Question:** What exactly does a Gen-AI engineer do that's different from a traditional ML engineer or software developer?

  By the end of this week, you'll have a concrete answer backed by hands-on experience with the tools, workflows, and thinking patterns that define this emerging discipline.

**Week 2 Preview: Implementing Transformers from Scratch**

With your environment configured and career vision clarified, Week 2 dives deep into the mathematical foundations of modern AI. You'll implement a GPT-style transformer from scratch in PyTorch, building intuitive understanding of attention mechanisms, positional encoding, and autoregressive generation.

**Preparation for Week 2:**
- Review linear algebra fundamentals (matrix multiplication, eigenvalues)
- Refresh PyTorch basics (tensors, autograd, nn.Module)
- Read "Attention Is All You Need" paper (optional but recommended)
- Ensure GPU access is working (local or cloud)

**Success Metric:** By Week 2's end, you'll have a working transformer that can generate coherent text, trained on a dataset of your choice, with every line of code written and understood by you.
