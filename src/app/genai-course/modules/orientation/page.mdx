With your environment configured and career vision clarified, Week 2 dives deep into the mathematical foundations of modern AI. You'll implement a GPT-style transformer from scratch in PyTorch, building intuitive understanding of attention mechanisms, positional encoding, and autoregressive generation.

**Preparation for Week 2:**
- Review linear algebra fundamentals (matrix multiplication, eigenvalues)
- Refresh PyTorch basics (tensors, autograd, nn.Module)
- Read "Attention Is All You Need" paper (optional but recommended)
- Ensure GPU access is working (local or cloud)

**Success Metric:** By Week 2's end, you'll have a working transformer that can generate coherent text, trained on a dataset of your choice, with every line of code written and understood by you.

Ready to build the future of AI? Your journey starts now.
