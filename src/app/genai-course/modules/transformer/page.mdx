### ðŸŽ¯ Module Overview

This is where theory meets reality. You'll implement a complete GPT-style transformer from scratch, building every component from mathematical first principles. No black boxes, no pre-built modulesâ€”just pure understanding through implementation.

### Attention Mechanism Mathematics

The self-attention mechanism is the heart of transformers. Here's the complete mathematical derivation:

  * **Input Processing:**
      * Given input sequence `$X \in \mathbb{R}^{n \times d_{\text{model}}}$`
      * Project to queries, keys, values:
        `$Q = XW\_Q$`, `$K = XW\_K$`, `$V = XW\_V$`
        where `$W\_Q, W\_K, W\_V \in \mathbb{R}^{d\_{\text{model}} \times d\_k}$`
  * **Attention Score Computation:**
      * Attention scores: `$S = \frac{QK^T}{\sqrt{d\_k}}$`
      * Causal mask: `$M\_{ij} = -\infty$` if `$i < j$`, else `$0$`
      * Masked scores: `$S\_{\text{masked}} = S + M$`
      * Attention weights: `$A = \text{softmax}(S\_{\text{masked}})$`
  * **Output Generation:**
      * Output: `$O = AV$`
      * Multi-head: `$O = \text{Concat}(\text{head}\_1, ..., \text{head}\_h)W\_O$`
        where `$\text{head}\_i = \text{Attention}(XW\_Q^i, XW\_K^i, XW\_V^i)$`
  * **Implementation Considerations:**
      * Numerical stability with large sequence lengths
      * Memory efficiency for attention matrix storage
      * Gradient flow through softmax operation
      * Parallelization across attention heads

### Training Stability & Optimization

  * **Gradient Analysis:**
    ```python
    def analyze_gradients(model, loss):
        """Monitor gradient statistics for training stability"""
        total_norm = 0
        param_count = 0
        
        for name, param in model.named_parameters():
            if param.grad is not None:
                param_norm = param.grad.data.norm(2)
                total_norm += param_norm.item() ** 2
                param_count += 1
                
                # Log per-layer gradient norms
                wandb.log({f"grad_norm/{name}": param_norm.item()})
        
        total_norm = total_norm ** (1. / 2)
        wandb.log({"grad_norm/total": total_norm})
        
        return total_norm
    ```
  * **Learning Rate Scheduling:**
    ```python
    def get_cosine_schedule_with_warmup(optimizer, num_warmup_steps, num_training_steps):
        """Cosine learning rate schedule with linear warmup"""
        
        def lr_lambda(current_step):
            if current_step < num_warmup_steps:
                return float(current_step) / float(max(1, num_warmup_steps))
            
            progress = float(current_step - num_warmup_steps) / float(max(1, num_training_steps - num_warmup_steps))
            return max(0.0, 0.5 * (1.0 + math.cos(math.pi * progress)))
        
        return LambdaLR(optimizer, lr_lambda)
    ```

### Memory Optimization Techniques

  * **Gradient Checkpointing:**
    ```python
    class CheckpointedTransformerBlock(nn.Module):
        def __init__(self, *args, **kwargs):
            super().__init__()
            # ... initialize layers ...
        
        def forward(self, x, mask=None):
            if self.training:
                return checkpoint(self._forward, x, mask)
            else:
                return self._forward(x, mask)
        
        def _forward(self, x, mask):
            # Actual forward pass
            attn_out = self.attention(self.norm1(x), mask=mask)
            x = x + self.dropout(attn_out)
            ff_out = self.ff(self.norm2(x))
            x = x + self.dropout(ff_out)
            return x
    ```
  * **KV Caching for Inference:**
    ```python
    class CachedAttention(nn.Module):
        def __init__(self, d_model, n_heads):
            super().__init__()
            self.d_model = d_model
            self.n_heads = n_heads
            self.head_dim = d_model // n_heads
            
            self.q_proj = nn.Linear(d_model, d_model)
            self.k_proj = nn.Linear(d_model, d_model)
            self.v_proj = nn.Linear(d_model, d_model)
            self.out_proj = nn.Linear(d_model, d_model)
            
            self.kv_cache = {}
        
        def forward(self, x, use_cache=False, cache_key=None):
            B, T, C = x.size()
            
            if use_cache and cache_key in self.kv_cache:
                # Use cached K, V and only compute for new tokens
                cached_k, cached_v = self.kv_cache[cache_key]
                
                # Only process the last token
                q = self.q_proj(x[:, -1:, :])  # (B, 1, C)
                k_new = self.k_proj(x[:, -1:, :])  # (B, 1, C)
                v_new = self.v_proj(x[:, -1:, :])  # (B, 1, C)
                
                # Concatenate with cache
                k = torch.cat([cached_k, k_new], dim=1)  # (B, T, C)
                v = torch.cat([cached_v, v_new], dim=1)  # (B, T, C)
                
                # Update cache
                self.kv_cache[cache_key] = (k, v)
            else:
                # Standard computation
                q = self.q_proj(x)  # (B, T, C)
                k = self.k_proj(x)  # (B, T, C)
                v = self.v_proj(x)  # (B, T, C)
                
                if use_cache:
                    self.kv_cache[cache_key] = (k, v)
            
            # Reshape for multi-head attention
            q = q.view(B, -1, self.n_heads, self.head_dim).transpose(1, 2)  # (B, nh, T, hs)
            k = k.view(B, -1, self.n_heads, self.head_dim).transpose(1, 2)  # (B, nh, T, hs)
            v = v.view(B, -1, self.n_heads, self.head_dim).transpose(1, 2)  # (B, nh, T, hs)
            
            # Attention computation
            att = (q @ k.transpose(-2, -1)) * (1.0 / math.sqrt(k.size(-1)))
            
            # Causal masking
            mask = torch.tril(torch.ones(T, T, device=x.device)).view(1, 1, T, T)
            att = att.masked_fill(mask == 0, float('-inf'))
            att = F.softmax(att, dim=-1)
            
            y = att @ v  # (B, nh, T, hs)
            y = y.transpose(1, 2).contiguous().view(B, -1, C)  # (B, T, C)
            
            return self.out_proj(y)
    ```
