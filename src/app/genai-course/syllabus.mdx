Projects mirror real-world engineering scenarios:
- **Code Reviews:** Peer and instructor feedback on technical implementation
- **Architecture Decisions:** Justifying technology choices and trade-offs
- **Performance Optimization:** Measuring and improving system efficiency
- **Documentation Standards:** Creating maintainable, professional-grade documentation

<SubSectionTitle>Open Source Commitment</SubSectionTitle>
All course materials, code repositories, and student projects are open source. This transparency enables:

<SectionTitle>👨‍💻 About the Instructor</SectionTitle>

This course represents a complete documentation of my journey from traditional software engineering to Gen-AI specialization. Rather than presenting polished theoretical content, I share the actual process of learning, experimenting, failing, and iterating that characterizes real engineering work.

**Philosophy:** The best way to learn engineering is by following someone who's learning it too. All my experiments, dead ends, and breakthroughs are documented with full transparency, creating an authentic roadmap for others to follow.

**Commitment:** Every line of code, every architectural decision, and every lesson learned is published openly. Students aren't just taking a course—they're participating in a live documentation of professional growth in one of technology's fastest-moving fields.
